       "[Document(id_='50229776', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Jenna Marie Ortega (born September 27, 2002) is an American actress. She began her career as a child and received recognition for her role as a younger version of Jane in The CW comedy-drama series Jane the Virgin (2014–2019). She then won an Imagen Award for her leading role as Harley Diaz in the Disney Channel series Stuck in the Middle (2016–2018). She played Ellie Alves in the thriller series You (2019) and starred in the family film Yes Day (2021), both for Netflix.\\nOrtega received praise for her performance as a traumatized high school student in the drama film The Fallout (2021). She gained wide recognition for portraying Wednesday Addams in the Netflix horror-comedy series Wednesday (2022–present), for which she received nominations at the Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. She also starred in the slasher films Scream, X (both 2022) and Scream VI (2023), which established her as a scream queen, and the fantasy film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024).\\nKnown for her work in horror, Ortega has been dubbed \"Gen Z\\'s scream queen\" by media publications. She has been featured on lists such as The Hollywood Reporter\\'s 2023 Power 100 and Forbes\\'s 2024 30 Under 30. Outside of acting, Ortega has been noted for her fashion, and has supported various charitable causes and worked as an ambassador for multiple brands.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJenna Marie Ortega, the fourth of six siblings, was born on September 27, 2002, in Palm Desert, California. Her father, a former sheriff who works at a California district attorney\\'s office, is of Mexican descent, and her mother, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, works as an emergency room nurse. Ortega\\'s maternal great-grandmother was an undocumented immigrant from Sinaloa, Mexico, and her maternal grandfather was from Puerto Rico. Ortega grew up in La Quinta, California, and has described her childhood self as \"loud and extroverted\". She wanted to act from the age of six and begged her mother to let her pursue a career for three years. Her mother attempted to distract her with other activities, including soccer and school. Ortega almost quit pursuing acting to participate in the former. Her mother later bought her a monologue book and posted a video of nine-year-old Ortega performing. A casting director watched the video and signed her to an agency.\\nOrtega\\'s mother began driving her to Los Angeles to attend auditions, a trip that sometimes took as long as six hours roundtrip, up to five days a week. She struggled to secure parts because few roles for Latinas existed and she \"didn\\'t look [a certain] way\"; such experiences damaged her self-esteem. She considered dyeing her hair blonde in an attempt to book more roles. For the first year, Ortega, who had no connections in the film industry, limited her auditions to commercials; she secured parts in 12 national campaigns, including three McDonald\\'s commercials. From Mondays to Fridays, she acted in Los Angeles for a few days and returned home to attend school. She enrolled in public school, attending Amelia Earhart Elementary School and John Glenn Middle School. She dropped out of school during eighth grade to act in Disney projects and got an apartment in Los Angeles after securing a role in Stuck in the Middle (2016–2018). During that time, Ortega worked in Los Angeles during the workweek and went home on weekends.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2012–2017: Early acting roles and Disney ===\\nOrtega made her acting debut in the sitcom Rob (2012) and later made a guest appearance in the CSI: NY episode \"Unspoken\". In 2013, she made her film debut in a minor role as the vice president\\'s daughter in the superhero film Iron Man 3. In the same year, Ortega appeared in the horror film Insidious: Chapter 2 as a part of the supporting cast. From 2014 to 2019, Ortega had a recurring role on The CW comedy television series Jane the Virgin as a younger version of Jane Villanueva, who is portrayed by Gina Rodriguez as an adult. Declan Gallagher of Entertainment Weekly commended Ortega\\'s performance, writing that \"she eschews the trappings of a typical child actor\". She also starred in the direct-to-video comedy film The Little Rascals Save the Day (2014) and the Netflix sitcom Richie Rich (2015). Ortega appeared in the comedy-drama film After Words (2015) as Anna Chapa, the daughter of a male escort. The Los Angeles Times praised her as \"adorable\", whereas The Arizona Republic found her \"horribly cloying\".\\nFrom 2016 to 2018, Ortega led the Disney Channel sitcom Stuck in the Middle as Harley Diaz, an aspiring inventor who is the middle child of the seven siblings. She said that booking the role was \"one of the best days of my life\". Ortega drew inspiration from her own family and relationships with her siblings; she felt her experience starring on the show was akin to reality television. Common Sense Media praised Ortega\\'s performance, saying she \"commands this role, pleading her case as a long-suffering middle kid while finding the humor in the many calamities that befall her efforts to shine\". Ortega garnered three Imagen Award nominations for Best Young Actor – Television, including a win in 2018. She also voiced Princess Isabel in Elena and the Secret of Avalor (2016) and Elena of Avalor (2016–2020).\\n\\n\\n=== 2018–2021: Transition to mature roles ===\\n\\nIn 2018, Ortega starred in the film Saving Flora in the lead role of Dawn, a circus owner\\'s daughter. After Stuck in the Middle ended, she aimed to act in more mature projects but found people assumed Disney roles were \"all you can do, or all you were meant for\". She considered quitting acting several times, saying that she \"was too old for the young roles and too young for the older roles\". In 2018, she was cast as Ellie Alves in the second season of the Netflix thriller series You, which was released on December 26, 2019. Like the show\\'s first season, the second season received positive reviews; The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Robyn Bahr noted Ortega as \"a standout performer\". Ortega was slated to return for the third and fourth seasons but was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. \\nOrtega played Phoebe, the love interest of Judah Lewis\\'s character, in Netflix\\'s horror film The Babysitter: Killer Queen, which was released in September 2020 to negative critical reviews. She also voiced a travel vlogger named Brooklynn in the Netflix animated show Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous (2020–2022). In 2021, she made her writing debut with the book It\\'s All Love: Reflections for Your Heart & Soul, which contains a series of quotes and statements regarding faith and love. She starred in the Netflix comedy movie Yes Day (2021), portraying a stubborn teenager who wants more independence from her parents. She appreciated how people of color were shown in \"a casual setting where it\\'s acknowledged\" in lieu of \"shoving it down your throat\". Yes Day was released in March 2021 to mixed reviews. IndieWire lauded Ortega as \"very capable\", and the Associated Press referred to her as \"an impressively poised young actor\". \\nOrtega had a leading role in the high-school drama film The Fallout, starring as a student who is navigating her emotional trauma after a school shooting. To prepare for the role, she looked at photographs and watched videos and interviews about school shootings; processing such events afterward \"kind of came naturally\". She also participated in the March for Our Lives movement, which led demonstrations in support of U.S. gun control legislation. Ortega, who describes herself as \"such an insecure individual\", found it easy to portray her character as relatable. The Fallout premiered at South by Southwest on March 17, 2021, and was released on HBO Max on January 27, 2022. The film received a positive response from critics, and Ortega\\'s acting was applauded. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times described her performance as \"grounded and deeply moving\", while The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her \"beautifully nuanced turn understands the nothing-to-look-at-here façade and the chinks in the armor\".\\n\\n\\n=== 2022–present: Mainstream breakthrough ===\\nIn the slasher film Scream (2022)—the fifth film in the Scream franchise—Ortega played Tara Carpenter, on which she stated: \"I don\\'t even think there are words in the English language to correctly express how happy, excited and nervous I am for this journey\". Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett cast Ortega because of her ability to play both horror and comic tones, and for the sound of her scream. She felt nervous about joining a well-known franchise, wanting to \"do it justice\" without \"ripping anybody off\". She said that working on the film taught her the importance of cast chemistry to the natural flow of the production process. Scream was a critical and commercial success, becoming the 28th-highest-grossing film of 2022. According to The A.V. Club, Ortega demonstrated \"incredible\" resilience and resolve in her role. She also won the MTV Movie Award for Most Frightened Performance.\\nOrtega later appeared in the Foo Fighters–led horror film Studio 666 (2022). Reviewers said she was underused; according to the Los Angeles Times, \"[n]ot even [a] cameo from ... 2022\\'s newly minted Scream Queen Jenna Ortega ... can offer true horror bona fides to this flick\". She then starred in the slasher film X (2022), which was directed and written by Ti West, who said Ortega was \"fearless in her commitment\". Ortega signed onto the project because of its script, calling it \"the most outrageous thing I\\'ve ever read\", and the opportunity to work with West. She found the filming process to be enjoyable and unique due to West\\'s style of shooting. X became Ortega\\'s best-reviewed film on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes; The Australian dubbed her and co-star Mia Goth \"scene-stealers\". The comedy-horror American Carnage was Ortega\\'s final film release of 2022. The A.V. Club said she was continuing \"her streak as the new it-girl of horror with a stubborn punk persona that masks her care for other people\", while IGN lauded her \"no-shits-given shell\".\\n\\nIn May 2021, Ortega was cast as Wednesday Addams in the Netflix comedy-horror series Wednesday (2022), which she called a \"new chapter\" in her career. She auditioned through a Zoom call with director Tim Burton, during which she read a four-page monologue. The casting team felt her portrayal offered the character the necessary empathy. She was initially hesitant to accept the part because she wanted to focus on film acting and feared working on another television series would prevent her from booking the roles she wanted. To prepare for the role, Ortega underwent \"the most physical transformation I\\'ve ever done\", cutting her hair and dying it black, as well as altering her mannerisms, style of speaking, and facial expressions. She also learned to play cello and speak German, read the original Addams Family comic, and watched the 1960s television adaptation. Ortega called the production of Wednesday\\'s first season her \"most overwhelming job\" in 2022, and spoke about being in a constant state of confusion and stress over the direction of the series and character. She said that she had never \"had to put my foot down on a set in the way that I had to on Wednesday\", believing that the initial writing was nonsensical from a character standpoint and did not suit Wednesday\\'s personality. While filming some scenes, Ortega would change her lines without informing the crew.\\nUpon Wednesday\\'s release, critics widely praised Ortega: CNN said that her performance sets the series apart from similar spin-offs, being \"relentlessly strange, a portrait in unblinking intensity and oddly endearing all at once\". Wednesday became one of Netflix\\'s most-watched shows, receiving over 1 billion viewing hours within a month. Ortega\\'s performance received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, becoming the category\\'s second-youngest nominee. She later spoke about her discomfort with becoming well-known for her work on the show, having had a creatively unpleasant experience filming it.\\nIn March 2023, Ortega hosted an episode of NBC\\'s sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live. Ortega reprised her role as Tara Carpenter in Scream VI. She said her character had more personality in the film than in the previous installment, in which she \"was screaming and crying the entire time\". When creating Tara\\'s personality, Ortega considered several of the character\\'s traits, including her favorite color, fashion style, makeup, and sense of humor. Scream VI was released in March 2023 and grossed over $169 million on a budget of $33–35 million. Deadline Hollywood attributed its box-office success partially to Ortega\\'s star power. In a review, Variety\\'s Owen Gleiberman praised her \"surly spunk\", and Slant Magazine said she \"fantastically embodie[d] the role\". In November 2023, Ortega reportedly exited the Scream franchise due to scheduling conflicts with the filming of Wednesday\\'s second season. The Hollywood Reporter later said she left the franchise after an unsuccessful request for seven-figure pay. In the crime thriller film Finestkind (2023), she played Mabel, a drug dealer\\'s daughter who is seeking her own path in life. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to negative reviews. Many journalists said Ortega had been miscast. \\n\\nOrtega began 2024 with a starring role in the drama Miller\\'s Girl, opposite Martin Freeman. The film tells the story of Cairo Sweet (Ortega), a high schooler whose writing ability captures her teacher\\'s interest, which leads to a complicated relationship between the two. She called her character \"the most complex character that I\\'ve ever played\" and described the material as risky since she thought it would provoke discussions on topics people may find disturbing. RogerEbert.com\\'s Christy Lemire found Ortega \"magnetic enough\" to maintain the viewer\\'s interest, although she thought the character\\'s motives were predictable and illogical; Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press dubbed the film \"a pointless, awkward turn\" in her career. Ortega appeared in and executive produced the romantic drama Winter Spring Summer or Fall, which premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Festival. Director Tiffany Paulsen described Ortega as the casting team\\'s first choice for the role of Remi Aguilar, a driven genius who falls in love with a rebellious musician. She later starred in the music video for Sabrina Carpenter\\'s song \"Taste\".\\nOrtega starred in Burton\\'s fantasy film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024)—a sequel to Beetlejuice (1988)—playing Astrid Deetz, the cynical teenage daughter of Lydia Deetz. It opened the 81st Venice International Film Festival and received generally positive reviews. The Guardian commented that Ortega portrayed her character with \"just the right note of soulful sullenness\". Rolling Stone said she was an \"unimpeachable\" casting choice and commended the emotions she conveyed using a \"world-class deadpan stare\". In a more negative review, The Independent stated that she \"can\\'t help but seem a little bland and strait-laced\" acting opposite Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse.\\n\\n\\n==== Upcoming projects ====\\nOrtega has joined the cast of Klara and the Sun (2025) to be directed by Taika Waititi. She is set to appear in and executive produce an untitled Trey Edward Shults film that will co-star The Weeknd and Barry Keoghan. She is due to star in Death of a Unicorn (2025), a dark comedy co-starring Paul Rudd, and Alba; both will be produced and distributed by A24.\\nOrtega is slated to reprise her role as Wednesday in the second season of Wednesday. She became an executive producer, which she described as a \"natural progression\" since the first season was \"naturally already very collaborative\". Ortega helped oversee the costumes, characters, and scripts.\\n\\n\\n== Other ventures ==\\n\\n\\n=== Activism and philanthropy ===\\nOrtega has used her platform to support various causes, including Pride Over Prejudice—a DoSomething campaign that advocates for immigrants and refugees—the National Bullying Prevention Center, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, Planned Parenthood, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS. She is pro-immigration and anti-discrimination, telling Teen Vogue: \"It\\'s important to embrace your culture today because there are so many different ethnicities in America. At the end of the day, you are you. You\\'ve got to stay true to yourself, and you can\\'t change yourself in order to fit in or to make someone else feel comfortable.\" Ortega is also an advocate for women\\'s rights.\\nIn 2016, Ortega organized a meet-and-greet event for fans to raise money for a young girl with cancer. At the 2018 Radio Disney Music Awards, Ortega wore a jacket displaying the words \"I Do Care and U Should Too\" in response to the clothing First Lady of the United States Melania Trump wore on a visit to see immigrant children who were being housed without their parents. Trump\\'s jacket read, \"I Really Don\\'t Care, Do U?\". Ortega\\'s protest gained significant media coverage; she told the Associated Press that Trump\\'s apparel displayed a lack of judgement and as the first lady, she ought to show concern for migrant children. Ortega later said: \"We should all care about each other and our country ... we are one country under God\". In 2019, Ortega appeared at numerous We Day benefit concerts across the U.S. and Canada to raise funds for WE Charity.\\nIn 2023, Ortega, as part of a group called Artists4Ceasefire, signed a letter urging the United States Congress and President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip during the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. She later condemned the Tel al-Sultan attack and emphasized the need for a ceasefire.\\n\\n\\n=== Endorsements ===\\nIn 2020, Ortega was named a brand ambassador for the cosmetics manufacturer Neutrogena and was the face of its \"My Quinceañera Journey\" campaign. In 2023, she became an ambassador for the sportswear company Adidas and the luxury fashion brand Dior. She was the face of Adidas Sportswear, the company\\'s first new line in 50 years, as well as one of the faces of the #DareInGrisDior campaign. She starred alongside Danny Ramirez, Olivia Negron, and Patricia Mauceri in an advertisement for Doritos that aired at the Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024. The A.V. Club enjoyed the ad but opined that fans of Wednesday would be dissatisfied by Ortega\\'s lack of goth,\\nwhile TVLine stated that her limited screen time was \"a real miscalculation\".\\n\\n\\n== Artistry ==\\n\\n\\n=== Influences ===\\nOrtega was initially inspired to pursue acting after watching Dakota Fanning in the 2004 thriller film Man on Fire. Ortega was unable to understand how a young child could perform in a way that could scare her so much; she analyzed the film several times and decided she wanted to be \"the Puerto Rican version of [Fanning]\". She also admired Fanning\\'s sister, Elle, and followed both of their careers as a child. As she matured, Ortega aspired to be \"the female version\" of Denzel Washington, who appeared alongside Dakota Fanning in Man on Fire. She also admires Gina Rodriguez and fellow Disney Channel stars Selena Gomez and Zendaya. Ortega said she admires Rodriguez because they are both Latina actresses who struggled to break into the acting industry due to their lack of connections. In 2021, Ortega named Riz Ahmed as a career role model and praised his acting, manner of speaking, and activism.\\n\\n\\n=== Acting style and role choices ===\\nMegan Park, who directed Ortega in The Fallout, said that she knows \"when to give her all and when to hold back\" while acting, adding that \"to have that understanding of herself as a performer at such a young age\" is extremely rare. Burton compared Ortega\\'s acting style to silent film acting, saying she expresses emotion through her eyes without words. Ortega says she tries not to be more prepared than necessary for a scene because \"you never know what you\\'re going to say next or what your next facial expression is going to be\" in real life.\\nThe Dodge College professor and agent Joe Rosenberg describes Ortega as an actress who has \"a feel for the right project at the right time\" and is \"savvy\" with her role choices. Ortega feels taking more varied acting roles is important to her to avoid being typecast; she told Entertainment Tonight in 2021 that she did not want to be \"pigeonholed as an actor\" and that her desire to accept the most diverse roles possible made the transition to mature roles easier for her. Ortega stated that she looks for projects that will have a \"forever effect\" for her, such as The Fallout. She has said she feels most comfortable starring in horror works, describing such projects as \"very therapeutic\". In 2023, Ortega said she is mindful of not \"over-indexing on the gore scale\" and feels \"very conflicted\" about her interests because there is \"a part of me that always feels like the girl in the Coachella Valley\".\\n\\n\\n== Media image ==\\n\\nCommenting on Ortega\\'s off-screen persona, Who What Wear wrote in 2022 that she is \"poised, mature, and wise beyond her years\" while providing \"an essence of relatability\". A 2023 Harper\\'s Bazaar story describes her as \"quiet and contemplative\", while Vanity Fair wrote that she has a \"black-hole persona\" but is \"much warmer and more cheerful than you\\'d expect\". Ortega has been noted for her work in horror and has been described as a horror icon by journalists. Media publications have dubbed her \"Gen Z\\'s scream queen\", and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association called her the \"scream queen for the 21st century\". Ortega attributes her \"instinctive\" scream and \"really ugly crying face\" for the positive reception her horror work has received from audiences.\\nIn 2018, The Hollywood Reporter named Ortega one of \"Hollywood\\'s Top 30 Stars Under Age 18\". The magazine later referred to her as the \"Next Big Thing\" in 2022 and \"The Gen Z Obsession\" in 2024. In 2023, Ortega appeared on Variety\\'s \"Young Hollywood Impact Report\", a list of breakthrough performers, and The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Power 100, a list of the most powerful women in entertainment. Complex also listed her among the best actors in their 20s. Forbes included her on the 2024 edition of its 30 Under 30 in the Hollywood & Entertainment category.\\nOrtega has also been called a style icon by Harper\\'s Bazaar. Her initial red-carpet style featured bright colors, patterned clothing, and many accessories. Enrique Melendez, her stylist, dressed Ortega in RED Valentino and Thom Browne, wanting her wardrobe to be age-appropriate, fashionable, and stylistically interesting. They later tried to move away from the \"feminine and flirty and frilly\" style of other Disney actresses. After her role in You, Ortega began wearing heavier makeup and darker clothing. Media publications said her later style borrowed from Wednesday\\'s while incorporating high fashion and described it as goth glam. According to Vogue, her off-screen style has a \"dark, gothic fashion sensibility\". Ortega said that playing Wednesday has \"changed my taste a lot\" and she has \"a hard time getting her off of me, at least clothing-wise\".\\nOrtega is active on Instagram but has described social media overall as being a \"comparing game\" and \"very manipulative\". She has said she became fearful of her comments on social media being misinterpreted following the release of Wednesday, adding: \"Because I naturally tend to be sarcastic or dry, it\\'s very easy for me to find myself in trouble ... [People] see your vulnerability and twist it in a way that you don\\'t always expect.\" As a minor, Ortega was sent explicit images of herself that were AI-generated, which later led to her deleting her Twitter account.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nOrtega stated that she would like to be a \"private person\" and not discuss her romantic life publicly, believing that it distracts audiences from her work. She has described the concept of celebrities as \"absolutely ridiculous\". Ortega has said that her friends and family give her a sense of safety that helps her deal with the more challenging parts of her career, adding that her family \"keep[s] [her] feet on the ground\". She states that growing up in an industry dominated by adults forced her to mature faster than normal.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\n\\n\\n=== Music videos ===\\n\\n\\n== Awards and nominations ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nJenna Ortega on Instagram\\nJenna Ortega at IMDb', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
       " Document(id_='70574547', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is a 2024 American gothic dark fantasy comedy horror film directed by Tim Burton from a screenplay by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. A sequel to Beetlejuice (1988) and the second film of the Beetlejuice franchise, the film stars Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, and Catherine O\\'Hara reprising their roles alongside new cast members Justin Theroux, Arthur Conti, Monica Bellucci, Jenna Ortega, and Willem Dafoe. Set more than three decades after the first Beetlejuice, it follows Lydia Deetz, now a mother, struggling to keep her family together in the wake of a loss as the specter Betelgeuse returns to haunt her.\\nAfter the success of Beetlejuice, plans for a sequel were announced by The Geffen Film Company, its original producers, and little materialized until 2011 when Warner Bros. Pictures hired Seth Grahame-Smith to pitch a story, which went through numerous revisions before being shelved in late 2019. Plans for a sequel were revived in early 2022, with Burton set to co-produce with Brad Pitt\\'s studio Plan B Entertainment. After the casting process finished in early 2023, principal photography, supervised by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, took place in parts of England and the U.S. from May to November, despite being suspended for four months due to the 2023 actors\\' strike. The official title was revealed in February 2024. During post-production, editing was handled by Jay Prychidny, and the musical score was composed by longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman.\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice opened the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2024, and was theatrically released overseas on September 4, 2024, and in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures two days later. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $443 million worldwide on an estimated $100 million budget, becoming the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn 2024, Lydia Deetz hosts the supernatural TV talk show Ghost House. She has been estranged from her daughter, Astrid, since Lydia\\'s ex-husband and Astrid\\'s father, Richard, died while in the Amazon. While taping an episode, Lydia hallucinates seeing Betelgeuse, the demon who tried to marry her 36 years earlier, in the audience.\\nShortly afterwards, Lydia\\'s stepmother, Delia, informs Lydia that her father, Charles, had been eaten by a shark. They and Astrid travel to Winter River, Connecticut, for Charles\\' funeral. At the wake, Rory, Lydia\\'s boyfriend and producer, pressures her to marry him on Halloween; she hesitantly agrees. Meanwhile, Astrid meets a local boy named Jeremy Frazier, who invites her to spend Halloween with him.\\nIn The Afterlife, Betelgeuse oversees an office of \"bio-exorcists\", assisted by Bob, an anxious shrunken-head ghost. Betelgeuse is still obsessed with Lydia. Former actor-turned-ghost detective Wolf Jackson warns Betelgeuse that his former wife, Delores, has escaped captivity and gone on a murderous spree, draining the souls of the dead searching for him. The couple met during the Black Plague in Italy, but Delores was a cult leader who poisoned Betelgeuse as part of an immortality ritual; he killed her before succumbing to the poison.\\nAstrid discovers she has inherited her mother\\'s psychic abilities and realizes Jeremy is a ghost; he persuades her to accompany him to the Afterlife to help regain his life. In exchange, she can meet her father\\'s spirit. Lydia learns from a local realtor that Jeremy murdered his parents twenty-three years earlier and died when the police tried to arrest him. Lydia reluctantly summons Betelgeuse and signs a marriage contract in exchange for him taking her to the Afterlife to save Astrid. Betelgeuse blows open a hole between the worlds of the Living and the Dead; he disguises Bob as himself as a decoy. Wolf discovers Betelgeuse has brought a living person into the Afterlife and launches a manhunt for him, capturing the disguised Bob. Delores meets Bob at the police station while continuing her search for Betelgeuse and drains Bob\\'s soul.\\nAs Betelgeuse and Lydia search for Astrid, Jeremy escorts her through the Afterlife\\'s bureaucracy. He admits to tricking Astrid into exchanging her life for his. Astrid is taken to the \"Soul Train\" to be sent to the Great Beyond. Richard spots and follows her. Lydia saves Astrid right before the Soul Train departs. They escape through a portal to Saturn\\'s moon Titan, where Richard saves them from a sandworm. While Betelgeuse sends Jeremy to Hell, Richard shows Lydia and Astrid how to return to the Living world. Meanwhile, during a mourning ceremony for Charles, Delia is bitten by two venomous asps that she was assured were defanged. She arrives in the Afterlife and summons Betelgeuse to help find Charles; he agrees in exchange that Delia will help him find Lydia.\\nAfter Lydia and Astrid escape from the Afterlife, Astrid tearfully apologizes to Lydia for not believing her about ghosts. The two arrive at the church for Lydia and Rory\\'s wedding. Betelgeuse appears with Delia and interrupts the ceremony. Betelgeuse uses a \"truth serum\" that forces Rory to admit he never believed in Lydia\\'s abilities and has only been using her for her money since they first met. Betelgeuse prepares to marry Lydia when Delores arrives seeking revenge. Wolf also arrives, but Betelgeuse freezes him and his comrades to avoid arrest and continue the wedding. Astrid opens a portal to summon a sandworm from Titan, and Betelgeuse leads it to devour Delores and Rory. Astrid reveals that because Betelgeuse illegally brought Lydia into the Afterlife, their marriage contract is voided. Lydia recites Betelgeuse\\'s name three times and banishes him back to the Afterlife. Delia returns to the Afterlife with Wolf. She is reunited with Charles as he is about to board the Soul Train to the Great Beyond.\\nAs everything returns to normal, Lydia ends her Ghost House show to spend more time with Astrid, but soon has recurring nightmares about Betelgeuse.\\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n\\nMichael Keaton as Betelgeuse, an afterlife ghost and \"bio-exorcist\" who wants to marry someone from the realm of the living. Both Keaton and director Tim Burton opted to keep the character as politically incorrect as he was in the original film due to their love for that character trait, with Burton deeming Betelgeuse as a character whose whole point is that he does not undergo any character arc or development, never evolving.\\nWinona Ryder as Lydia Deetz, the former gothic teenager who was almost forced to marry Betelgeuse, now mother of Astrid Deetz and hostess of the Ghost House with Lydia Deetz show. Ryder initially imagined her character would live as a spinster in the Maitland residence\\'s attic, but appreciated the development of  her character, particularly around her relationship with daughter Astrid.\\nCatherine O\\'Hara as Delia Deetz, Lydia\\'s stepmother, Astrid\\'s stepgrandmother, and Charles Deetz\\'s widow, now the hostess of a real art show located in a SoHo gallery\\nJenna Ortega as Astrid Deetz, Lydia\\'s teenage daughter and Delia\\'s step-granddaughter\\nJustin Theroux as Rory, Lydia\\'s current boyfriend and a television producer. Rory was inspired by Otho, Delia Deetz\\'s interior design and exorcist friend played by the late Glenn Shadix in the original film. Writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar devised him as a character who everyone wanted to see getting his comeuppance, like Otho, and enjoying the idea of Lydia being in a weird codependent relationship which everyone sees that way, herself included. Gough and Millar wanted the audience to understand why Rory is with Lydia and that he was a \"schmuck\", but they felt that they needed to find Rory\\'s humanity without him being a mere punchline. Once Theroux was cast and connected with the writers over Zoom, he provided Gough and Millar with ideas they incorporated.\\nWillem Dafoe as Wolf Jackson, a ghost detective who, in life, was a B movie action star\\nMonica Bellucci as Delores, Betelgeuse\\'s ex-wife who, in life, was a mysterious soul-sucking witch who poisoned Betelgeuse several centuries earlier during the Black Plague before he killed her with an axe in retaliation\\nArthur Conti as Jeremy Frazier, an undead teenage murderer who is Astrid\\'s brief love interest\\nBurn Gorman as Father Damien, a reverend in Winter River\\nSantiago Cabrera as Richard, Astrid\\'s late father and Lydia\\'s former husband who disappeared in Brazil\\'s Amazonas\\nDanny DeVito as an afterlife janitor whose soul was consumed by Delores\\nNick Kellington as Bob, a shrinker and Betelgeuse\\'s lead employee at the Afterlife Call Center whose soul was also consumed by Delores\\nAmy Nuttall as local real estate agent Jane Butterfield Jr., the daughter of the first film\\'s Jane Butterfield Sr., portrayed in the previous film by Annie McEnroe\\nPaul Warren as Tom, a bald, one-eyed shrinker and one of Betelgeuse\\'s employees at the Afterlife Call Center\\nMark Heenehan (physical) and Charlie Hopkinson (voice) as Charles Deetz, Lydia\\'s father and Delia\\'s deceased husband who was decapitated by a shark, hence why he goes to the afterlife without his upper half. The character is depicted with the likeness of original actor Jeffrey Jones through various means, including archival photos, paintings and an animated stop motion sequence that describes the character\\'s death. The character\\'s death was inspired by a nightmare of Burton\\'s about his own death.\\nJane Leaney and David Ayres portray Mrs. and Mr. Frazier, Jeremy\\'s murdered parents. Georgina Beedle portrays Janet, Wolf Jackson\\'s secretary who \"keeps him real\", while Filipe Cates portrays Vlad, a young man dressed as a vampire who marries Astrid in Lydia\\'s dream.\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nAfter the success of Beetlejuice (1988), a sequel was fast-tracked by The Geffen Film Company. Two Beetlejuice sequel scripts were commissioned in 1990: the first, Beetlejuice in Love, was penned by screenwriter Warren Skaaren, who did a heavy re-write on the first film\\'s script. In Skaaren\\'s sequel, Betelgeuse meets Leo, who tragically plummets to his death while proposing to his girlfriend, Julia, on the Eiffel Tower. When Leo enters the afterlife, Betelgeuse escapes to the world of the living and pursues Julia. Skaaren died shortly after turning in his first draft of the In Love script. That same year, Tim Burton hired Jonathan Gems to write a potential Beetlejuice sequel titled Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian. \"Tim thought it would be funny to match the surfing backdrop of a beach movie with some sort of German Expressionism, because they\\'re totally wrong together\", Gems said. The story followed the Deetz family moving to Hawaii, where Charles is developing a resort. They soon discover that his company is building on the burial ground of an ancient Hawaiian Kahuna. The spirit comes back from the afterlife to cause trouble, and Betelgeuse becomes a hero by winning a surf contest with magic. Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder agreed to do the film, on the condition that Burton directed, but both he and Keaton became occupied with Batman Returns (1992).\\nBurton was still interested in Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian in early 1991. Impressed with Daniel Waters\\' work on Heathers (1989), which also stars Winona Ryder, Burton approached him for a rewrite. However, he eventually signed Waters to write the script for Batman Returns. By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (Troop Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live) to rewrite. Warner Bros. approached Kevin Smith in 1996 to rewrite the script, although Smith turned down the offer in favor of Superman Lives. Smith later joked that his response was, \"Didn\\'t we say all we needed to say in the first Beetlejuice? Must we go tropical?\" In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying, \"The Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian script is still owned by The Geffen Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn\\'t do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it.\" Burton had considered several other sequel ideas as well over the years, saying in 2024, \"We talked about lots of different things. That was early on when we were going, Beetlejuice and the Haunted Mansion, Beetlejuice Goes West, whatever. Lots of things came up\", but all those initial scenarios set in Hawaii, the Wild West or Paris, France were all scrapped.\\nIn September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who collaborated with Burton on Dark Shadows and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (both 2012), to write and produce a sequel to Beetlejuice. Grahame-Smith signed on with the intention of doing \"a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone\\'s throat\". He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton had not officially signed on but would return if the script was good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, \"We talked for a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It\\'s a priority for Warner Bros. It\\'s a priority for Tim. [Michael\\'s] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he\\'ll talk to anybody about it who will listen.\"\\n\\nIn November 2013, Ryder hinted at a possible return for the sequel as well by saying, \"I\\'m kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It\\'s 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later.\" Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, \"It\\'s a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There\\'s only one Betelgeuse. We\\'re working on a script and I think it\\'s probably closer than ever and I\\'d love to work with him again.\" In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles.\\nWhile negotiating to join the Netflix show Stranger Things as Joyce Byers in mid-2015, Ryder accepted that role under the sole request to the Duffer Brothers that if a Beetlejuice sequel ever got greenlighted, they would let her take a break from the series to film it, as she and Burton had been having conversations about the project since 2000; the Duffers agreed. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, \"It\\'s something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it\\'s one of those films where it has to be right. It\\'s not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it\\'s not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it\\'s something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael\\'s amazing as that character, so yeah we\\'ll see. But there\\'s nothing concrete yet.\" In October 2017, Mike Vukadinovich was hired to re-write the script. In April 2019, Warner Bros. stated the sequel had been shelved.\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-production ===\\nIn February 2022, a sequel was announced again, this time produced by Brad Pitt\\'s studio Plan B Entertainment, alongside Warner Bros. Burton stated in October 2022 that he was not involved in the project, but backtracked days later, saying \"nothing is out of the question\". Burton ultimately returned as the film\\'s director and tried to strip everything from the story to go to the basics of working with \"good people, actors and puppets\", feeling that the project made him reflect why he liked making movies. Burton came up with the film\\'s story upon thinking about Lydia Deetz, a character of his with whom he connected as a teenager, wondering what could have been of her life after the first film\\'s events and how her family life could have developed, turning from a \"cool teenager\" into a \"f—ed-up adult\" who hosts a popular medium-related show titled Ghost House with Lydia Deetz whose daughter hates her, Burton credited the years of his life since the original film\\'s release as the reason he couldn\\'t do Beetlejuice Beetlejuice until then, having experienced many of those things himself, finding the project a very personal movie starring a weird family in a family-friendly and emotional story of three generations experiencing basic things everyone feels in life when growing up. Burton and Keaton agreed to not use excessive amounts of technology, and sought to make the film feel \"handmade\". With a plot likened to Willy Wonka\\'s psychedelic boat ride in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), which takes \"very big swings\" like unhinged and uncontrollable phantasmagoria and Burton\\'s head being \"dumped out\" onto the screen, Keaton felt the film\\'s story to be stronger than its predecessor\\'s, with \"more of a connection\" to the audience in terms of characters, finding \"beyond delightful\" things he wasn\\'t ready for while Ryder confidently expressed her belief that the film exceeded her high expectations and expected every generation to find something they can appreciate from the film.\\nIn March 2023, it was reported by Variety that Jenna Ortega, who previously worked with Burton on the 2022 Netflix series Wednesday, was in talks to play Astrid Deetz, Lydia\\'s daughter, while Burton was now expected to direct the film. Ortega and Ryder bonded as they worked together, sharing hobbies such as both being cinephiles and regarding the experience of working with each other special, resulting in Ortega developing her own performance for Astrid. In May, Danny Elfman announced he was returning to compose the score for the sequel, while it was also revealed Ortega was confirmed to star, and Wednesday creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar wrote the script. Justin Theroux, Burn Gorman, Arthur Conti, Filipe Cates, and Willem Dafoe would also be added to the cast, in undisclosed roles, with Dafoe\\'s being described as an afterlife officer. Dafoe later explained to Variety at the Marrakesh Film Festival that his character is an afterlife police officer who used to be a B movie action star in life before dying in an accident, with his skills leading him to become a detective within the realm. He later regretted sharing those details about his character, fearing that Burton may get angry with him for revealing a few spoilers from the film. Conti auditioned for the role over a Zoom call with Burton and a chemistry test with Ortega, receiving the news that he got the part on April Fools\\' Day, leading him to initially dismiss it as a practical joke. Catherine O\\'Hara reprises her role as Delia Deetz, as well as Monica Bellucci joining the cast as Betelgeuse\\'s wife Delores. Gough didn\\'t originally write Delores\\' first victim, a deceased janitor, with an actor in mind, so Burton called his frequent collaborator Danny DeVito for the role and DeVito accepted it.\\nColleen Atwood, a frequent collaborator of Burton, was announced to be working on the costume design for the film. Atwood disclosed that Betelgeuse\\'s striped suit would return in the film, as it is trademark to the character\\'s quintessential appearance in the same way the titular character of Lewis Carroll\\'s novel Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) sports an iconic blue dress, although Keaton disagreed and preferred Betelgeuse\\'s burgundy tuxedo. O\\'Hara later confirmed that the film would include Harry Belafonte\\'s 1955 song \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\", which was featured in the first film and serve as an unofficial memorial for Belafonte, who died just before the start of filming. The writers decided that the wedding sequence would feature a musical number with Betelgeuse \"being the crazy ringleader of that whole situation\", but were unsure of what song to use, and Burton suggested \"MacArthur Park\", which Gough found to be \"the crazy, weird, insane thing you need at the end of this movie\". Keaton insisted that Betelgeuse had limited screen time in the film like the first movie, saying, \"The idea was, no, no, no, you can\\'t load it up with Betelgeuse, that\\'ll kill it, the Betelgeuse character doesn\\'t drive the story as much as he did in the first one. He\\'s more part of the storyline in this one as opposed to the first one, which is a case of, this thing comes in and drives the movie a little bit.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Filming ===\\nFilming was originally scheduled to begin in mid-2022. Later, it was delayed to an expected start date of May 10, 2023, taking place in London if the 2023 WGA strike did not lead to another delay in production. Production was officially confirmed to have begun the following day, with Haris Zambarloukos serving as cinematographer and Jay Prychidny serving as editor. On May 18, 2023, it was reported that filming was taking place around the Princess Helena College in Preston, Hertfordshire, England. Exterior filming took place in East Corinth, Vermont (the location of the original movie\\'s outdoor scenes), in mid-2023. Filming was suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Burton described the film, which he enjoyed making, as being \"99% done\". It had two days of production left, which was interrupted, with Ortega being contacted to continue filming four days after the strike had ended. Filming resumed on November 16, 2023, in Melrose, Massachusetts, and wrapped in Vermont on November 30, 2023.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-production ===\\nBy March 2024, Keaton had seen a completed rough cut of the film and stated that further editing would occur thereafter. Later that month, it was stated in The Hollywood Reporter that Jeffrey Jones would not reprise his role as Charles Deetz in the film, his character being revealed in the trailers to have been killed off; it had been speculated that Jones didn\\'t return due to legal issues Jones had in the interim and the controversy surrounding films he has made since the early 2000s due to his status as a registered sex offender.\\nIn April, Geena Davis stated she would not be returning as Barbara Maitland due to her age, saying, \"Our characters were stuck the way they looked when they died forever, so it\\'s been a while, it\\'s been a minute.\" In August, Burton would confirm via People that Davis and Alec Baldwin didn\\'t return for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice as the Maitlands weren\\'t needed for the story he wanted to tell, which he admitted that he personally couldn\\'t have done in 1989 due to it focusing on three generations within the Deetz family. To explain their absence, Burton stated that the film would reveal the Maitlands used a loophole to leave their former house during the interim between this film and the original. Gough told Entertainment Weekly that an early draft for the film had the Maitlands making a cameo appearance at the end, he and Millar discussing the idea with Burton, but all three moved on from the concept as they felt no de-aging technology would be convincing enough to make the audience believe that Davis and Baldwin hadn\\'t aged since 1988. Also, they felt that the Maitland couple\\'s story had been told and their appearance would clash with Burton\\'s decision to not make any fan service. In any event, much like Jones, legal issues would have prevented Baldwin from returning for the film due to the then-ongoing Rust shooting incident that saw Baldwin accidentally shoot and kill  cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film Rust.\\nThe production VFX supervisor was Angus Bickerton, working with VFX producer Alex Bicknell, supported by visual effects studios Framestore, One of Us and BUF.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\n\\nDanny Elfman, who scored Beetlejuice, returned for the sequel. The soundtrack to the film featured licensed music being incorporated in the film as well as two cues from Elfman\\'s score being included. A cover of \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\" is performed by Alfie Davis and the Sylvia Young Theatre School Choir and was released on May 23, 2024. The 11-song soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music on August 30, 2024, and a vinyl edition is set to be released by Waxwork Records.\\n\\n\\n== Release ==\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice opened the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2024, at the Sala Grande in a non-competitive slot. The film was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on September 6, 2024, including IMAX, 4DX and ScreenX engagements. Warner Bros.\\' former regime considered releasing the film straight to streaming on Max, but Burton butted heads with the studio over the film\\'s costs and distribution; Warner was unsure on spending a projected $147 million on a sequel to a 1980s film from Burton, who hadn\\'t had a hit since Alice in Wonderland (2010). Burton\\'s demands were granted once Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group co-chairs and CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy were installed in their positions in 2022, who agreed to a major theatrical release if the budget was under $100 million; Burton reportedly spent $99 million, thus fulfilling the deal. Initially, the film was supposed to be delayed to 2025, because of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, despite most of the production having been completed. However, in February 2024, the producers reiterated the release date as well as revealing the official title. At their 2024 CineEurope presentation, Warner Bros. announced that the film would be released overseas on September 4, 2024, two days before its domestic premiere. The promotion included tie-in marketing deals with CarMax, Progressive, Secret, Denny\\'s, Fanta, NYX and Sally Hansen.\\n\\n\\n=== Home media ===\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice was released in 4K Ultra HD to video-on-demand platforms on October 8, 2024, with a DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD (Steelbook) physical release expected to follow November 19, 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Box office ===\\nAs of November 1, 2024, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice has grossed $290.0 million in the United States and Canada, and $153.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $443.1 million.\\nIn the United States and Canada, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice was released alongside The Front Room and was projected to gross $100–110 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $42 million on its first day, including $13 million from Thursday night previews. The film went on to debut with $111 million, registering the second biggest opening of September (behind It), the second biggest for Burton\\'s career (behind Alice in Wonderland), and the third biggest opening of the year (behind Deadpool & Wolverine and Inside Out 2). Around 7.7 million admissions, 73% of the total weekend\\'s box office earnings, came from the film alone. The opening weekend gross surpassed the entire $74 million run of the original film, unadjusted for inflation. The film then grossed $51.6 million in its second weekend (a drop of 54%), and $25.9 million its third weekend (a drop of 49%), beating newcomers Speak No Evil and Transformers One, and finishing in first for three consecutive weeks. It was eventually dethroned by The Wild Robot in its fourth weekend, grossing $16 million.\\nInternationally, the film debuted with $36.2 million from 69 markets. It had the biggest openings in the UK ($9.6 million), Mexico ($6.5 million), Australia ($2.6 million), Spain ($2.5 million) and Italy ($1.7 million).\\n\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of 352 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"Michael Keaton\\'s devious poltergeist still has plenty of juice left in this madcap return to form for Tim Burton, marrying charming practical effects and ghoulish gags to provide a fun fun time.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 61 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, up from the \"B\" earned by the first film, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an 81% overall positive score, with 68% saying they would definitely recommend it.\\nManohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film a \"fun but less edgy sequel\". Xan Brooks, writing for The Guardian, stated, \"Burton\\'s game attempt to bring the 1980s horror-comedy back from the spirit world is full of gaudy set-pieces but fails to add much to the original.\" Margaret Roarty of The Film Magazine stated that \"the filmmaker manages to create something just as wacky and weird and meaningful as the original film.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Controversy in Poland ===\\nIn Poland, the scene where Astrid Deetz wears a Halloween costume, dressing up as 19th-century Polish-French scientist Marie Skłodowska-Curie, sparked a controversy, because Deetz refers to Skłodowska-Curie as only a \"French scientist\". Even though Marie was naturalised French, she was born and raised in Poland. As she kept a strong sense of Polish identity, using both of her surnames and naming the first chemical element she discovered polonium after her native country, she is widely considered a Polish scientist, especially in Poland. The Polish dub of the film corrected this mistake, with Skłodowska-Curie described as \"the Polish physicist\".\\n\\n\\n== Future ==\\nWhen asked about a potential third film, Burton said, \"Let\\'s do the math... it took 35 years to do this, so I\\'ll be over 100. But I guess it\\'s possible with the advent [sic] of science these days, but I don\\'t think so.\"\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice at IMDb', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Having come to attention playing quirky characters in the late 1980s, she achieved success with her more dramatic performances in the 1990s. Ryder\\'s many accolades include a Golden Globe, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and a Grammy Award.\\nFollowing her film debut in Lucas (1986), Ryder rose to prominence when she starred in the comedy Beetlejuice (1988). Major parts in Heathers (1989), Edward Scissorhands and Mermaids (1990), Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula (1992) came next. She earned two consecutive Oscar nominations—Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress—for her portrayals of a socialite in The Age of Innocence (1993) and Jo March in Little Women (1994), respectively. Her subsequent work included starring roles in Reality Bites (1994), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), The Crucible (1996), Alien Resurrection (1997), Celebrity (1998), Girl, Interrupted (1999), and Mr. Deeds (2002).\\nRyder took a break from acting in the early 2000s, after the significant negative media attention brought by her arrest in 2001 for shoplifting, later returning with smaller appearances in films such as Star Trek (2009), Black Swan (2010), and The Dilemma (2011). She portrayed Lois Wilson in the Hallmark television film When Love Is Not Enough (2010). Since 2016, she has played Joyce Byers on the Netflix series Stranger Things, for which she received her third Golden Globe nomination. She has since starred in the HBO miniseries The Plot Against America (2020) and the comedy horror sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024).\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nWinona Laura Horowitz was born in Winona County, Minnesota, to Cynthia Palmer (née Istas) and Michael D. Horowitz. Winona\\'s mother is an author, video producer, and editor, and her father is an author, editor, publisher, and antiquarian bookseller. He also worked as an archivist for psychologist Timothy Leary (Ryder\\'s godfather). Winona\\'s father\\'s family is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and hails from Ukraine and Romania. Growing up, Winona visited her paternal grandparents in Brooklyn for the Jewish Holiday of Passover, every year.\\nNamed after Winona, Minnesota, Winona Ryder was given her middle name, Laura, because of her parents\\' friendship with Laura Huxley, writer Aldous Huxley\\'s wife. Winona\\'s stage name derives from Mitch Ryder, a soul and rock singer of whom her father was a fan. Her father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist. Winona has a younger brother, Urie (named in honor of the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin), and two older half-siblings from her mother\\'s prior marriage: half-brother Jubal Palmer and half-sister Sunyata Palmer. Winona\\'s family friends were her godfather Timothy Leary, the Beat Movement poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and the science fiction novelist Philip K. Dick. In 1978, when she was seven years old, she and her family relocated to Rainbow, a commune near Elk, Mendocino County, California, where they lived with seven other families on a 300-acre (120 ha) plot of land. As the remote property had no electricity or television sets, Winona began to devote her time to reading and became an avid fan of J. D. Salinger\\'s The Catcher in the Rye.\\n\\nWhen she was ten, Winona Ryder and her family moved to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied by children who mistook her for an effeminate boy. In 1983, 12-year-old Ryder enrolled at the American Conservatory Theater in nearby San Francisco, where she took her first acting lessons. During the same year, she nearly drowned; the experience caused her to develop aquaphobia. The psychological trauma caused problems later in her life during the underwater scenes in Alien Resurrection (1997), some of which had to be reshot numerous times. Ryder continued to be bullied through high school, when she achieved early film success with Beetlejuice: \"I remember thinking, \\'Ooh, it\\'s like the number-one movie. This is going to make things great at school.\\' But it made things worse. They called me a witch.\" In 1989, Ryder graduated from Petaluma High School with a 4.0 GPA.\\nRyder has said that her natural hair color is brown, but she was \"really blonde as a kid\"; when she was 11 or 12, she started dyeing her blonde hair blue and purple. At the time of her audition for the 1986 film Lucas, her hair had been dyed black and the filmmakers asked her to keep it.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1985–1990: Early roles and breakthrough ===\\n\\nIn 1985, Ryder sent a videotaped audition, where she recited a monologue from the novel Franny and Zooey by J. D. Salinger, to appear in the film Desert Bloom. Although the role went to Annabeth Gish, writer/director David Seltzer cast her in his high school drama Lucas (1986), which starred Corey Haim, Charlie Sheen, and Kerri Green. When asked how she wanted her name to appear in the credits, she suggested \"Ryder\" as her surname because a Mitch Ryder album that belonged to her father was playing in the background. Winona\\'s next film was Square Dance (1987), where her teenage character creates a bridge between two different worlds—a traditional farm in the middle of nowhere and a large city. She won acclaim for the performance, with the Los Angeles Times calling it \"a remarkable debut.\" Both films were only marginally successful commercially.\\nAfter seeing her in Lucas, director Tim Burton cast Winona Ryder in his film Beetlejuice (1988). She starred as a goth teenager whose family moves to a haunted house populated by ghosts played by Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, and Michael Keaton. The film was a success at the box office, and the film as well as Ryder\\'s performance received mostly positive reviews from critics. Also in 1988, she appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Robert Downey Jr. in 1969, a drama about the Vietnam War and the tensions it created in American families.\\nRyder next starred in the independent film Heathers (1989). The film, a satirical take on teenage life, featured Ryder and Christian Slater as high school sweethearts who begin killing off popular students. Her agent initially begged her to turn the role down, saying the film would \"ruin her career\". Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, and Ryder\\'s performance was positively received, with The Washington Post calling Ryder \"Hollywood\\'s most impressive ingénue […] Ryder […] makes us love her teen-age murderess, a bright, funny girl with a little Bonnie Parker in her. She is the most likable, best-drawn young adult protagonist since the sexual innocent of Gregory\\'s Girl.\" Despite its critical success, Heathers was a box-office flop, but has achieved the status of a cult film in following decades. Ryder’s other 1989 starring role was in the biopic Great Balls of Fire!, in which she played the 13-year-old bride (and cousin) of rock’n’roll idol Jerry Lee Lewis. The film was a box-office failure and received mixed reviews from critics. Ryder also appeared in 1989 in the music video for Mojo Nixon\\'s \"Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child\".\\nRyder began the 1990s with three starring roles. In the fantasy film Edward Scissorhands (1990), she reunited with director Tim Burton to play the female lead alongside her then-boyfriend Johnny Depp. The film was a significant box office success, grossing $86 million and receiving much critical devotion. Ryder\\'s second role of the year was in the family comedy-drama Mermaids (1990), which co-starred Cher, Bob Hoskins, and Christina Ricci. Mermaids was a moderate box-office success and Ryder\\'s performance was acclaimed; critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"Winona Ryder, in another of her alienated outsider roles, generates real charisma.\" For her performance, Ryder received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and a National Board Review award for the same category. Following Mermaids, Ryder had the lead role as a troubled teenager in the comedy-drama Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990). The film co-starred Jeff Daniels and was deemed a commercial flop. In 1990, Ryder also made a cameo in Roy Orbison\\'s music video \"A Love So Beautiful\" with Matthew Modine, and was awarded \\'ShoWest\\'s Female Star of Tomorrow\\' by The National Association of Theatre Owners. She was next slated to appear as Mary Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola\\'s The Godfather Part III, but withdrew from the project in the beginning of filming in 1990 due to nervous exhaustion.\\n\\n\\n=== 1991–2000: Established actress ===\\nIn 1991, Ryder played a young taxicab driver in Jim Jarmusch\\'s independent film Night on Earth. The film was given a limited release, but received critical praise. Ryder then starred in three big-budget adaptations of literary classics. The first was Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and featuring Ryder in the dual role of Mina Murray and Count Dracula’s past lover, Princess Elisabeta. The script was originally intended for a television adaptation but Ryder liked it so much she brought it to Coppola’s attention. The film premiered in November 1992 to critical and commercial success.\\nRyder continued her work in period films with Martin Scorsese\\'s The Age of Innocence (1993), an adaptation of Edith Wharton\\'s novel that co-starred Michelle Pfeiffer and Daniel Day-Lewis. Ryder considers Scorsese \"the best director in the world\". For her portrayal of May Welland, the fiancée of Newland Archer (Day-Lewis), Ryder won a Golden Globe and received Academy Award and BAFTA nominations as well. Although not a commercial success, the Age of Innocence received critical praise upon its release in October 1993. Vincent Canby in the New York Times wrote, \"Ms Ryder is wonderful as this sweet young thing who\\'s hard as nails, as much out of ignorance as of self-interest.\" \\nRyder next starred alongside Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Antonio Banderas, and Glenn Close in the melodrama The House of the Spirits (1993), based on Isabel Allende\\'s novel. Also released in October 1993, the film was poorly reviewed and a box-office flop, grossing just $6 million on its $40 million budget. Ebert wrote that Ryder ”seems an unlikely casting choice but she is more convincing, with more abandon and passion, and she makes her character work.\" Ryder was next set to star in Broken Dreams with actor River Phoenix. The project was put on hold due to his death on October 31, 1993. In 1993, Ryder also appeared on the music video \"Without a Trace\" by Soul Asylum, whose member Dave Pirner was her boyfriend at the time.\\n\\nRyder\\'s next film, the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994), marked a departure from period films. Directed by Ben Stiller and co-starring Ethan Hawke, the film featured Ryder as a recent college graduate searching for direction in life. According to Hawke and Stiller, the film got greenlit only due to Ryder\\'s star status. Her performance received acclaim but the film did not meet its studio’s expectations in the box office. Ryder returned to period films later that year, appearing as Jo March in Little Women, an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\\'s novel. The film received widespread praise; critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it was the greatest adaptation of the novel and that \"Ms. Ryder, whose banner year also includes a fine comic performance in Reality Bites, plays Jo with spark and confidence. Her spirited presence gives the film an appealing linchpin, and she plays the self-proclaimed \\'man of the family\\' with just the right staunchness.\" Ryder received her second Oscar nomination for the role, this time as Best Actress. In 1994, Ryder also made a guest appearance in The Simpsons episode \"Lisa\\'s Rival\" as Allison Taylor, whose intelligence and over-achieving personality makes her an adversary of Lisa.\\nRyder\\'s next starring role was in How to Make an American Quilt (1995), an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Whitney Otto, co-starring Anne Bancroft, Maya Angelou, and Ellen Burstyn. The film grossed nearly four times its budget and received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The same year, Ryder narrated Anne Frank\\'s The Diary of a Young Girl, for which she received a Grammy Award nomination. A review by Audiofile praised her performance, saying, \"Winona Ryder is the perfect narrator for this work. Her voice sounds very young, matching the 14-year-old\\'s enthusiasm and frustrations.\"\\n\\nRyder made several film appearances in 1996, the first in Boys. The film failed to become a box office success and attracted mostly negative critical reaction. Ebert wrote: \"Boys is a low-rent, dumbed-down version of Before Sunrise, with a rent-a-plot substituting for clever dialogue\", calling the film a waste of Ryder\\'s talent. Her next role was in Looking for Richard, Al Pacino\\'s meta-documentary on a production of William Shakespeare\\'s Richard III, which grossed only $1 million at the box office but drew moderate critical acclaim. She starred in The Crucible with Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen. The film, an adaptation of Arthur Miller\\'s play, centered on the Salem witch trials. It was expected to be a success, considering its budget, but was a commercial failure. Despite this, it was well received and Ryder\\'s performance was lauded, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone writing, \"Ryder offers a transfixing portrait of warped innocence.\" Ryder later claimed that the role of Abigail Williams was the hardest in her whole career.\\nRyder next took on a role as an android in Alien Resurrection (1997), alongside Sigourney Weaver, who stars in the first four  Alien films. Ryder\\'s brother, Uri, was a fan of the series, and when approached about it, she agreed to the project. The film became one of the least successful entries in the Alien film series, but irrespective of the film series was considered a success as it grossed $161 million worldwide. Ryder\\'s and Weaver\\'s performances drew mostly positive reviews, and Ryder won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Actress. In his review of the film, Ebert commented that Ryder lacked the conviction and presence to stand alongside Weaver and the rest of the cast. He compared her with Jenette Goldstein in Aliens. \"Ryder is a wonderful actress, one of the most gifted of her generation, but wrong for this movie,\" he wrote. At 1997\\'s ShoWest event, she was presented with the \\'Female Star of the Year\\' award.\\nOn Valentine\\'s Day, 1998, Ryder performed in Eve Ensler\\'s play The Vagina Monologues. She then starred in Woody Allen\\'s Celebrity (1998), after Drew Barrymore turned down Ryder\\'s role, in an ensemble cast. The film satirizes the lives of several celebrities. In 1998, Ryder also appeared in the music video for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion\\'s song \"Talk About the Blues\"; a screenshot from the video later appeared on the cover of their album Xtra-Acme USA. In 1998, Ryder and Leonardo DiCaprio narrated Survivors: Testimonies of the Holocaust, a CD-ROM produced by Steven Spielberg\\'s Shoah Foundation. She also served as a member of the jury, led by Martin Scorsese, at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\\nIn 1999, Ryder starred in and served as an executive producer for Girl, Interrupted, based on the 1993 memoir of the same name by Susanna Kaysen. The film had been in development since late 1996, but took time to begin filming. Ryder was deeply attached to the project, calling it her \"child of the heart.\" She played Kaysen, who has borderline personality disorder and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for recovery. Directed by James Mangold and co-starring Angelina Jolie, the film was expected to mark Ryder\\'s comeback playing leading roles. Instead, it turned out to be the \"welcome-to-Hollywood coronation\" for Jolie, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Ebert wrote: \"Ryder shows again her skill at projecting mental states; one of her gifts is to let us know exactly what she\\'s thinking, without seeming to.\" He later called Ryder one of the reasons to see the film. The same year, Ryder was parodied in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. She also started her own music company, Roustabout Studios, in 1999.\\nIn April 2000, Ryder was awarded the Peter J. Owens Award at the San Francisco Film Festival. Her next film, the melodrama Autumn in New York, co-starring Richard Gere, was released in August. The film received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success, grossing $90 million at the worldwide box office. In September, Ryder made a guest appearance in the series finale of Comedy Central\\'s Strangers With Candy. She then played a nun of a secret society loosely connected to the Roman Catholic Church and determined to prevent Armageddon in Lost Souls (2000), a commercial failure. Ryder refused to do commercial promotion for the film. She later said, \"I was attracted to Lost Souls because I know nothing about this subject. I personally don\\'t believe in demonic possession. For me to play this woman was a real challenge. She is the ultimate believer. Most of all, I just wanted to do a movie in the thriller genre, at least one.\" On October 6, 2000, Ryder received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\\n\\n\\n=== 2001–2005: Hiatus ===\\nIn 2001, Ryder began a four-year career hiatus. Apart from a guest appearance on NBC\\'s sitcom Friends, playing Rachel\\'s college sorority sister, and a brief cameo in Ben Stiller\\'s comedy Zoolander (2001), she appeared in no new releases in 2001. She was scheduled to appear in Lily and the Secret of Planting, but withdrew from the project after being hospitalized for a severe stomach-related disorder in August 2001. In December 2001, Ryder was arrested for shoplifting, which made it difficult for her to be insured for further film projects. Woody Allen wanted to cast Robert Downey Jr. and Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda (2003), but was unable to do so because \"I couldn\\'t get insurance on them ... We couldn\\'t get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. ... We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on Celebrity] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again.\"\\nIn 2002, Ryder appeared in two movies filmed before her arrest. The first was a romantic comedy, Mr. Deeds, with Adam Sandler, grossing over $126 million in the United States alone. The film was not a critical success; film critic Philip French called it a terrible film, saying that \"remakes are often bad, but this one was particularly bad.\" The second film was the science fiction drama Simone, in which she portrayed a glamorous star who is replaced by a computer simulated actress due to the clandestine machinations of a director, portrayed by Al Pacino. On May 18, 2002, Ryder hosted Saturday Night Live. In 2005, Ryder co-produced and co-narrated the documentary The Day My God Died (2004) with Tim Robbins, which focuses on international child sex trafficking.\\n\\n\\n=== 2006–2015: Return to film ===\\n\\nRyder made a career return with appearances in several independent films in 2006 and 2007. The first was The Darwin Awards (2006), in which she acted alongside Joseph Fiennes. The second was Richard Linklater\\'s A Scanner Darkly, a film adaptation of Philip K. Dick\\'s novel, in which she co-starred opposite Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey, Jr. and Woody Harrelson. The film was made entirely with rotoscope software, which was used to turn live-action scenes into animation. The next year, Ryder appeared in David Wain\\'s comedy The Ten, and reunited with Heathers screenwriter Daniel Waters for the surreal black comedy Sex and Death 101. She also starred in the Kirsten Dunst-directed short horror film Welcome and made a brief appearance in the music video for \"We\\'re All Stuck Out In The Desert\" by Jonathan Rice.\\nIn 2008, Ryder played the female lead opposite Wes Bentley and Ray Romano in Geoffrey Haley\\'s offbeat romantic drama The Last Word. She then starred as a newscaster in the film adaptation of The Informers. She also appeared in director J. J. Abrams\\'s Star Trek, as Spock\\'s human mother Amanda Grayson. Several media outlets noted Ryder\\'s return to film during this time. In 2009, Ryder starred alongside Robin Wright and Julianne Moore in Rebecca Miller\\'s The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009).\\nThe next year, Ryder had a prominent supporting role as an aging ballet star in Darren Aronofsky\\'s Black Swan. She also starred in the independent film Stay Cool alongside Hilary Duff, Mark Polish and Chevy Chase, and in the television movie When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story. For her performance as Lois Wilson, whose husband co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous in 1930s, Ryder was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries. Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"Ryder played her character with wide eyes of both innocence and terror.\" Ryder next appeared in a leading role in Ron Howard\\'s The Dilemma (2011), co-starring Vince Vaughn and Kevin James.\\n\\nRyder then played Deborah Kuklinski, the wife of contract killer Richard Kuklinski, in the thriller The Iceman (2012), co-starring Michael Shannon. She also appeared with her The Iceman co-star James Franco in The Letter (2012). She reunited with director Tim Burton, who directed her in the music video for The Killers\\' single, \"Here with Me\", and cast her in the animated 3D feature film Frankenweenie (2012). Ryder also worked with the classic film channel TCM in 2012, guest hosting for a week in September, while Robert Osborne was on vacation, and introducing some of her favorite classic films in December.\\nIn 2013, Ryder appeared in the action thriller Homefront (2013), again opposite James Franco, this time playing a meth-addicted woman. Steven Boone of RogerEbert.com wrote: \"Ryder often seems on the verge of laughing in Franco\\'s face as he attempts to manhandle and pimp-talk her. But it\\'s nice to see her raven eyes and regal cheekbones on a big screen again, in whatever capacity.\" Ryder also starred in a segment of the Comedy Central television series Drunk History (2013) called \"Boston\". She played religious protester Mary Dyer opposite stern Puritan magistrate John Endicott, played by Michael Cera. She then took on the role of Peggy Shippen, the wife of Benedict Arnold, in her appearance of the second season of Drunk History (2014). In 2014, Ryder appeared in the British television film Turks & Caicos (2014) and modeled in the Fall advertising campaign of fashion label Rag & Bone.\\nIn 2015, Ryder was a juror at the Sundance Film Festival. She continued her work in television with the HBO miniseries Show Me a Hero (2015), in which she played the president of the Yonkers City Council. She then starred alongside Peter Sarsgaard in the biopic Experimenter, playing the wife of Stanley Milgram. Experimenter was released to positive reviews in October 2015. Ryder also appeared in advertisements for Marc Jacobs, both for their cosmetics and for their spring 2016 collection.\\n\\n\\n=== 2016–present: Stranger Things and resurgence ===\\nSince 2016, Ryder has starred in the Netflix science fiction-horror series Stranger Things, created by The Duffer Brothers, playing Joyce Byers, a single mother whose 12-year-old son Will vanishes mysteriously. The Duffer brothers said that Ryder \"has a very intense energy about her ... a wiry unpredictability, a sort of anxiousness that we thought we\\'d really lean into.\" The series\\' first season premiered in July 2016 to critical acclaim and high audience ratings. Ryder also received praise for her performance, and the cast won the SAG Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2017. The second and third seasons of the series were released in October 2017 and July 2019. For season 3, she was paid a reported $350,000 per episode. The filming for the fourth season had been halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but resumed in September 2020. The first volume of season 4 premiered on May 27, 2022, and the second volume on July 1, 2022. Kate Bush\\'s 1985 song \"Running Up That Hill\" reached number one on iTunes after the song was included in scenes of Stranger Things, after Ryder frequently wore Kate Bush T-shirts and lapel badges on set.\\nIn 2018, Ryder appeared in the film Destination Wedding, alongside Keanu Reeves. The same year, Ryder also starred in a L\\'Oréal shampoo commercial, and in H&M\\'s spring collection campaign co-starring Elizabeth Olsen. In 2020, Ryder appeared in Squarespace\\'s Super Bowl commercial, which aired during the first half of the game. Later that year, she starred in The Plot Against America, an HBO limited series based on Philip Roth\\'s 2004 novel of the same name. David Simon, the creator of the series, said: \"Winona always had the standing of the great American ingenue. Now we\\'re ready for the second act, because she\\'s always been a remarkable actor—always asking questions about the role, doing the research, and then feeling the camera instinctively once the work begins.\" The series was Ryder\\'s second collaboration with Simon; in 2014, she appeared in his HBO miniseries Show Me a Hero.\\nIn 2021, Ryder reprised her role as Kim Boggs in Edward Scissorhands alongside Timothée Chalamet in a Super Bowl ad for Cadillac. Her next film was Gone in the Night, co-starring Dermot Mulroney. As early as 1992, Ryder had expressed her willingness to appear in a sequel to Beetlejuice, hinting at such a return in a November 2013 interview, provided that Burton and Keaton were involved, and confirmed again in August 2015 that she would reprise her role in the sequel. The sequel, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, finally went forward in the 2020s, with filming wrapped in late 2023 for a 2024 release.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nRyder maintains homes in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Williamsburg in New York City. She is Jewish and has experienced antisemitism. She suffers from insomnia and has been a victim of stalking.\\nShe has credited her career to director Tim Burton.\\nRyder has been involved in philanthropic work since her twenties for the American Indian College Fund, which sends low-income Native Americans to universities.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationships ===\\nRyder met Johnny Depp at the Great Balls of Fire! premiere in June 1989. In February 1990, the 18-year-old Ryder began dating the 26-year-old Depp after they were reintroduced by a mutual friend. They became engaged in July of that year, but split up in June 1993. She dated Soul Asylum band member Dave Pirner and Helmet frontman Page Hamilton. She dated actor Matt Damon from 1998 to 2000. Since 2011, she has been in a relationship with fashion designer Scott Mackinlay Hahn.\\n\\n\\n=== Polly Klaas ===\\n\\nIn 1993, Ryder offered a reward in the hope that it would lead to the return of kidnapped child Polly Klaas. Klaas lived in Petaluma, where Ryder grew up. Ryder offered a $200,000 reward for Klaas\\'s safe return. After the girl\\'s death, Ryder dedicated her performance as Jo in the 1994 film adaptation of Little Women, one of Klaas\\'s favorite novels, to Klaas\\'s memory. \\n\\n\\n=== Legal issues ===\\nOn December 12, 2001, Ryder was arrested on shoplifting charges in Beverly Hills, California, accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories from a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley assembled a team of eight prosecutors and filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations failed to produce a plea bargain at the end of summer 2002 as the prosecution insisted on charging Ryder with a felony and not a  misdemeanor. Joel Mowbray from National Review noted that the prosecution also refused the store\\'s request to drop the charges.\\nShe was accused of using drugs, including oxycodone, diazepam, and Vicodin without valid prescription, but prosecutors dropped a drug possession count after it was proved that a doctor provided it to her as a medical treatment. She was convicted of grand theft and shoplifting but acquitted on the charge of burglary. In December 2002, she was sentenced to three years of probation, 480 hours of community service, $3,700 in fines, and $6,355 in restitution to the Saks Fifth Avenue store, and ordered to attend psychological counseling and drug counseling. On June 18, 2004, Superior Court Judge Elden Fox reviewed Ryder\\'s probation report and observed that she had served 480 hours of community service, and the felonies were reduced to misdemeanors. She finished her probation in December 2005.\\nRyder later explained that the incident occurred during a difficult time in her life in which she was clinically depressed. She added that the pain-killing medication, which a \"quack\" physician had prescribed her, clouded her judgment significantly. Jules Mark Lusman, who prescribed the medication, subsequently had his medical license revoked by the Medical Board of California for unethically prescribing medication to his patients.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography and awards ==\\n\\nRyder has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\\n\\n66th Academy Awards (1994): Best Supporting Actress, nomination, for The Age of Innocence\\n67th Academy Awards (1995): Best Actress, nomination, for Little Women\\nRyder has been nominated for three Golden Globe Awards (winning one), one British Academy Film Award, seven Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), and one Grammy Award.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nWinona Ryder at IMDb\\nWinona Ryder at the TCM Movie Database \\nWinona Ryder at AllMovie\\nWinona Ryder at Rotten Tomatoes', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"
